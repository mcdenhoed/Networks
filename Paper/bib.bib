 abstract = {The onion routing network is used to protect Internet initiators and responders against both eavesdropping and traffic analysis from other users of the Internet. In the onion routing of the invention, instead of making connections directly to a responding machine, users make connections through onion routers. The onion routing network allows the connection between the initiator and responder to remain anonymous. Anonymous connections hide who is connected to whom and for what purpose from outside eavesdroppers.}
