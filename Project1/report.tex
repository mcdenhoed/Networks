\section*{Approach and Challenges}
My approach on this project was very simple. I was provided with a one-way chat client programmed in Java. It was fairly simple to then convert this into a two-way chat client (by creating the relevant \verb+InputStreamBuffer+s and \verb+PrintWriter+s). The main challenge once this was completed was to make my code non-blocking. This was easily done by putting one direction of communication in its own thread.
\section*{Feedback}
This project was fairly easy, especially since source for a 1-way-talk program was provided. It served as a good re-introduction to Java.
